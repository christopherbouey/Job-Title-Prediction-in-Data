# Job-Title-Prediction-in-Data

### Goal
- Using machine learning, I will aim to predict the job title of a job in data based on the skills required and the responsibilities detailed. I will use NLP to vectorize the job descriptions and then traina supervised ML model on the data. 

### How has this been solved?
- This problem has been addresed specifically in an artivle on medium (https://medium.com/@washingtonwang/experiment-predicting-job-title-based-on-skill-sets-716228ec6178. 

### What is new about my approach
- My approach will be novel in that I will assess the jobs that seem most appropriate for someone in my position: ML Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer

### Who Cares?
- The highly dynamic data field has notoriously ambiguous job titles and responsibilities between companies. By peforming ML on them, I can attempt to draw a clearer distinction on the the job categories based on the current state of the job market. This would help employers to appropriately title their job postings to connect with the desired candidates, as well as help job seekers to apply to the jobs most heavily related to their interests or skills, streamlining the job search process. 

### How will I present?
- I will present my project through github, and will have interactive word clouds to show a visually appealing and clear comparison between the various roles, 

### Data source
- There are countless job postings through the various job serach platforms that I will web scrape on. I would aim to have at least ~5,000 job postings per title.

### Potential Problems
- There may be an industry or geographical component that is heavily correlated to job titles, which may make it more difficult to glean meaningful results. For this reason I will likely limit my data to San Francisco, if I can get enough data that was posted recently (because I want to look at this moment in time and not consider postings dating too far back, as again it is very temporally dynamic).

### Next thing?
- Web Scraping
